Password Generator is a html/css/javascript coded site that creates a random password based on input from the user. After the user answers a prompt and confirms a few selections they click the 'generate!' button to create a random password utilizing their responses. 

The purpose of this project is to be able to quickly create random passwords that can contain upper and or lower case letters, special characters, and numbers, if the user chooses. 

This site utilizes html, css, and javascript code. The javascript coding is heavily focused on arrays, 'if' statements and a few functions as well. Console logging is of high importance to be able to retrieve the user's input and there are many variables defined to pull together creating the password. 

To test the site, user's can vary their criteria and check that what the site returns is inline with their selections.
